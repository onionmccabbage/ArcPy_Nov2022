ArcGIS and ArcPy Review Exerise 40 mins - but we will see
===============================
Do this all in new Python file(s) OR in Notebooks
Continue with the 'ex8' resources. 
Write code to create a duplicate of all the airports
In this copy, change all Seaplane Bases to 'Sea'
Then make an extract of all airports where TotalENP < 1000 (as a parameter in a function)
In ArcGIS add this extract to the map

Show-and-tell - talk through the code and see the results
